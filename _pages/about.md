Welcome to Kyle's home page!

I am currently a 4-th year Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Economics at Cornell University. I received my Masters degree from the Department of Economics at University of Wisconsin Madison. My research interests are in econometrics and macroeconomics, both theoretical and applied. Specifically, I am interested in applications in empirical processes, time series, partial identification and information economics.

My advisors are Yongmiao Hong (chair), Francesca Molinari (co-chair) and Kristoffer Nimark.

Beside research, I am interested in rock climbing, snowboarding, water skiing... name all the sports!
